# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim Config

Note, this was an old config--my current one is significantly more advanced. I keeping this repo, so I can backup older configuration files in case I revert changes. 

Don't trust some of the more complicated files as I wa new to Lua, but maybe it can give you some inspiration.  




## Mini-files

Mini-files config was obtained from Maria's config, but has been modified. You can now press "<leader>e" to see a tree view structure, press it again to go to the root dir.

## Thank you
