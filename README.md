# ðŸ’¤ LazyVim Config

I have changed the plugins I use, but have kept the old ones as they're a bit opinionated. You may prefer to use neo-tree and telescope, for example. These are still in the config files but have been set to enabled = false.

## UI config

There are two ui files, ui and ui-2; the former converts line numbers to a rainbow colour. The latter disables relative line numbers on the inactive buffer e.g. if you have a split window, the line numbers will be less visible. It's useful if you want to find a line. However, it does not convert line numbers into rainbow colours.

You can switch ui files easily in init.lua; similarly, I have commented out code for tokynight theme. I should remove this altogether, but I am forever undecided with my colour themes!

## Mini-files

Mini-files config was obtained from Maria's config, but has been modified. You can now press "<leader>e" to see a tree view structure, press it again to go to the root dir.

## Thank you

Special thanks to theprimeagen, maria, and typecraft (I may have forgotten some people). Their advice & config files have been tremendously helpful to me:
